## Description

This is a web page that allows a user to take a timed quiz on front-end coding. The quiz has ten randomly-sorted questions and a 60-second time limit question by question to see the correct answers and the ones they picked.

## Usage

Upon clicking to start the quiz, the user steps through question-by-question. The questions each have four clickable options.

Upon completion of the quiz, the user is invited to submit their score to a locally-stored list of scores. Whether or not they choose to do so, they can view that list, which is sorted by score, and then by time remaining.

The user can take the quiz as many times as they wish, and can opt to score each result in the table

With the help of instruction and guidance of the staff of the UofM coding boot camp, nor without the resources at W3 and the Mozilla Developers Network. I was able to write the code the best I can.
